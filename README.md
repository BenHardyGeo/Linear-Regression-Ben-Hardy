# Linear-Regression-Ben-Hardy
This project applies multilinear regression to predict the price of used cars. It’s a supervised learning project, so the target data has been supplied. The notebook (Cars4U_Project_BenHardy) was generated for the second project of the Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Business Applications from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas. The data was provided in a .csv file.

There is a fair amount of data conditioning and some feature engineering at the top of the workbook. This is followed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data encoding and finally Model Building. The model is then QC’ed by checking for, and removing multicollinearity, testing linearity, homoscedasity and normality.
